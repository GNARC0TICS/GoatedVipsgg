# Vercel Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix deployment issues on Vercel.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Schema Generic Error in token-service.ts
- **Issue**: Property 'apiKeys' does not exist on type 'DrizzleTypeError'
- **Solution**: Updated token-service.ts to prioritize environment variables for API tokens and use dynamic imports for the apiKeys schema to avoid circular dependencies.
  - Added a fallback mechanism to use `process.env.API_TOKEN` first before trying to get the token from the database
  - Fixed import issues that were causing circular dependencies
  - Added improved error handling for schema loading failures

### 2. File Casing Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Case-sensitive filesystems (like on Vercel/Linux) treat 'Profile.tsx' and 'profile.tsx' as different files
- **Solution**: Standardized all file references to use lowercase 'profile.tsx'
  - Removed the uppercase 'Profile.tsx' file to avoid confusion
  - Ensured all imports consistently use the lowercase version
  - Enhanced the profile.tsx component with proper user authentication

### 3. Component Type Compatibility
- **Issue**: Component props mismatch in EmailVerificationStatus (isVerified vs verified)
- **Solution**: Ensured all components use the correct property naming
  - Verified that EmailVerificationStatus uses 'verified' property
  - Updated profile.tsx to use the correct property when rendering the component

### 4. Missing/Incorrect Auth Hooks
- **Issue**: Missing useUser hook or login/register methods
- **Solution**: Verified that use-user.ts and auth.tsx have the correct methods and hooks
  - Confirmed that useUser hook exports login/register methods needed by auth-page.tsx
  - Ensured auth.tsx provides the necessary context for user authentication

## Additional Improvements

1. **Improved Vercel Configuration**: Added a proper vercel.json file with optimized settings
   - Set appropriate routes for API and frontend
   - Configured build process correctly
   - Specified region for consistent deployments

2. **Authentication & API Optimization**:
   - Improved token handling to prioritize environment variables
   - Enhanced error handling for auth workflows
   - Added fallback paths for token retrieval

These changes address all the TypeScript errors found in the Vercel deployment logs.
