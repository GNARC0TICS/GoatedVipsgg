                <p className="text-[#8A8B91] leading-relaxed">
                  Provable fairness is a method in online gaming that guarantees
                  every game outcome is determined by a truly random process,
                  free from manipulation by the operator or any other party.
                  This ensures that all players have equal odds of winning and
                  that the results are entirely random and unpredictable.

                <ul className="text-[#8A8B91] space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
                  <li>Game seed: A random value generated by our server</li>
                  <li>
                    Client Seed: A value created by your device at the start of
                    the game, in order to add the next layer of randomness
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cryptographic Nonce: A value that ensures it is impossible
                    for an identical set of seed to occur
                  </li>

                <p className="text-[#8A8B91] mt-4">
                  These three components are processed by our random number
                  generator to produce the game's outcome. This combination
                  ensures the results are random and cannot be manipulated.
