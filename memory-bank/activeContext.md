# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- **API Token Management**: Implementing a comprehensive token management system for the Goated.com API.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing database optimizations and enhancing API resilience.
- **Error Handling**: Improving error handling and fallback mechanisms across the application.
- **Deployment Readiness**: Ensuring the application is ready for production deployment.
- **Updating Documentation**: Reflecting recent changes in the Memory Bank for consistent project knowledge.

## Recent Changes

- **API Token Management System**: Implemented a comprehensive token management system with:
  - TokenService class for storing, validating, and managing API tokens
  - ApiService class providing centralized access to external APIs with retry logic
  - Admin UI for monitoring token status and expiration
  - Email notifications for token expiration
  - JWT token validation and automatic expiration detection
- **Database Optimization**: Implemented strategic indexes and improved connection pooling for better performance.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for API interactions.
- **Leaderboard Improvements**: Enhanced the leaderboard component with better caching and fallback data.
- **Wager Race Resilience**: Improved the WagerRacePosition component with better error handling and fallback data.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented proper database connection closing during application shutdown.
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Added detailed health check endpoints for better monitoring.
- **API Resilience**: Created fallback data mechanisms for when external APIs are unavailable or rate-limited.

## Next Steps

- **API Health Check**: Implement a scheduled task to verify API health and token validity.
- **Token Rotation System**: Develop a mechanism for automatic token rotation when necessary.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all new features work seamlessly.
- **Deployment Preparation**: Update documentation and prepare the application for deployment following `PRODUCTION.md`.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Post-deployment, monitor the platform for any issues and gather user feedback for future improvements.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **API Integration Strategy**: Using a secure, maintainable approach to external API integration with proper token management.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Ensuring the application remains functional even when external APIs are unavailable.
- **Design Consistency**: Ensuring new features follow the existing theme and practices used in our codebaseâ€”modern, futuristic, and highly micro-interactive.
- **Future Enhancements**: Leaving room for adding additional verification methods (e.g., phone verification) and advanced search filters.
- **User Experience Focus**: Prioritizing seamless navigation and ease of use across all functionalities.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintaining accurate and consistent stats throughout the platform, especially with automated updates upon verification.
