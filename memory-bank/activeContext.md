## Current Focus: Enhancing API Token Resilience, UI Improvements, and Deployment Optimization (March 2025)

We've completed a major update to the API token and data fetching logic in the system to make it more resilient to API outages while maintaining a good user experience

### Key Changes Implemented

#### Server-Side Enhancements

1. **Improved Fallback Data Strategy**
   - Modified `fallback-data.ts` to use real cached data rather than generating mock data
   - Added timestamps to cached data to clearly indicate when it was last updated
   - Implemented proper empty data structures when no cache is available

2. **Enhanced Caching System**
   - Updated `leaderboard-cache.ts` with a scheduled background refresh mechanism
   - Reduced cache time to 2 minutes for fresher data while maintaining resilience
   - Added detailed metadata to cached responses (isCached, cachedAt, servedAt)
   - Improved error handling with better fallback paths

3. **API Service Improvements**
   - Modified `api-service.ts` to pass errors up to the cache layer for more consistent handling
   - Added improved retry logic with customizable timeouts

#### Client-Side Enhancements

1. **Use-Leaderboard Hook Upgrades**
   - Added toast notifications to inform users when they're viewing cached data
   - Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks to cached data
   - Added complete TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

2. **UI Components**
   - Updated `LeaderboardTable.tsx` to show visual indicators when displaying cached data
   - Added timestamp display to show users when the data was last refreshed
   - Simplified text styling on main page headings to use subtle drop shadows instead of complex effects
   - Added Tailwind text-shadow utilities for consistent text shadow application across the site

#### Deployment Optimizations

1. **Replit Configuration**
   - Enhanced `.replit` file with proper port mapping (5000→80, 5001→443, 5173→8080)
   - Added development and production workflow configurations
   - Configured proper environment variables for different deployment modes
   - Added proper build and start commands for reliable deployment

2. **Domain Routing**
   - Implemented `domain-router.ts` middleware for handling multi-domain routing
   - Configured goombas.net to direct to admin interfaces
   - Set up goatedvips.gg to handle public-facing features
   - Added automatic redirects based on domain-specific access patterns

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env.sample` with documented environment variables
   - Added proper configuration flags for development vs. production
   - Implemented feature flags for conditional functionality
   - Set up Replit-specific environment settings

### Current API Token Strategy

Our current approach uses a hierarchical strategy for API data:

1. Try to fetch fresh data from the primary API endpoint
2. On failure, try fallback API endpoints
3. If all API requests fail, use cached data with clear visual indicators
4. If no cache exists, show empty structures instead of fake data

This approach maintains data integrity and user trust by:
- Never showing false data
- Clearly indicating when data is stale
- Continuously attempting to refresh in the background
- Preserving the last known good state

### Next Improvements to Consider

- Implement a more sophisticated token refresh mechanism that doesn't require server restarts
- Add analytics to track API failure rates and response times
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated API calls during outages
