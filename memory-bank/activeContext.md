## Current Focus: Vercel Migration, Enhanced Serverless Compatibility, and Deployment Optimization (March 2025)

We've completed the optimization of the platform for Vercel deployment with enhanced serverless compatibility while maintaining all existing functionality. This includes database connection optimization, improved caching strategy, and adaptation to Vercel's serverless architecture.

### Key Changes Implemented

#### Server-Side Enhancements

1. **Improved Fallback Data Strategy**
   - Modified `fallback-data.ts` to use real cached data rather than generating mock data
   - Added timestamps to cached data to clearly indicate when it was last updated
   - Implemented proper empty data structures when no cache is available

2. **Enhanced Caching System**
   - Updated `leaderboard-cache.ts` with a scheduled background refresh mechanism
   - Reduced cache time to 2 minutes for fresher data while maintaining resilience
   - Added detailed metadata to cached responses (isCached, cachedAt, servedAt)
   - Improved error handling with better fallback paths

3. **API Service Improvements**
   - Modified `api-service.ts` to pass errors up to the cache layer for more consistent handling
   - Added improved retry logic with customizable timeouts

#### Client-Side Enhancements

1. **Use-Leaderboard Hook Upgrades**
   - Added toast notifications to inform users when they're viewing cached data
   - Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks to cached data
   - Added complete TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

2. **UI Components**
   - Updated `LeaderboardTable.tsx` to show visual indicators when displaying cached data
   - Added timestamp display to show users when the data was last refreshed
   - Simplified text styling on main page headings to use subtle drop shadows instead of complex effects
   - Added Tailwind text-shadow utilities for consistent text shadow application across the site

#### Deployment Optimizations

1. **Replit Configuration**
   - Enhanced `.replit` file with proper port mapping (5000→80, 5001→443, 5173→8080)
   - Added development and production workflow configurations
   - Configured proper environment variables for different deployment modes
   - Added proper build and start commands for reliable deployment

2. **Domain Routing**
   - Implemented `domain-router.ts` middleware for handling multi-domain routing
   - Configured goombas.net to direct to admin interfaces
   - Set up goatedvips.gg to handle public-facing features
   - Added automatic redirects based on domain-specific access patterns

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env.sample` with documented environment variables
   - Added proper configuration flags for development vs. production
   - Implemented feature flags for conditional functionality
   - Set up Replit-specific environment settings

### Current API Token Strategy

Our current approach uses a hierarchical strategy for API data:

1. Try to fetch fresh data from the primary API endpoint
2. On failure, try fallback API endpoints
3. If all API requests fail, use cached data with clear visual indicators
4. If no cache exists, show empty structures instead of fake data

This approach maintains data integrity and user trust by:
- Never showing false data
- Clearly indicating when data is stale
- Continuously attempting to refresh in the background
- Preserving the last known good state

### New Vercel-Specific Enhancements (March 2025)

1. **Database Connection for Serverless**
   - Migrated from traditional PostgreSQL connection pool to `@neondatabase/serverless`
   - Implemented connection caching and optimized for serverless cold starts
   - Created health check functions specific to serverless environment
   - Removed connection pool management in favor of serverless-optimized patterns

2. **Case Sensitivity Fixes**
   - Corrected file path issues that work on macOS/Windows but fail on Linux (Vercel)
   - Standardized file naming conventions (Profile.tsx vs profile.tsx)
   - Fixed import statements to match case-sensitive paths

3. **Authentication Middleware Improvements**
   - Refactored authentication system to work in serverless context
   - Created proper helper functions for auth state checking
   - Fixed TypeScript type definitions for user authentication

4. **Schema Organization**
   - Added proper `db/schema/index.ts` to re-export all schema definitions
   - Fixed import paths throughout application for consistent schema access
   - Ensured proper typing throughout the application 

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` with migration details
   - Documented required environment variables for Vercel
   - Added guidance on serverless function limits and best practices

### Next Improvements to Consider

- Set up monitoring and analytics in the Vercel environment
- Implement a more sophisticated token refresh mechanism that doesn't require server restarts
- Add analytics to track API failure rates and response times
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated API calls during outages
- Add Vercel-specific error tracking and logging
