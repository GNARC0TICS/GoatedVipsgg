# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- **Fixing API Integration Issues**: Resolving 404 errors with wager race and leaderboard components to ensure data loads properly for all visitors.
- **Enhancing Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms throughout the application.
- **Deployment Configuration**: Optimizing Replit deployment to support both admin and public user access.
- **Updating Documentation**: Reflecting recent changes in the Memory Bank for consistent project knowledge.

## Recent Changes

- **API Token Update**: Updated the expired API token with a new valid token to restore API connectivity.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling in the leaderboard cache utility to better handle API failures and use fallback data.
- **Frontend Component Improvements**: Updated LeaderboardTable and WagerRacePosition components to display user-friendly error messages.
- **React Hooks Fixes**: Fixed React hooks errors in LeaderboardTable and WagerRacePosition components by ensuring hooks are called unconditionally and updating import statements.
- **Dual-Port Server Configuration**: Implemented a dual-port server setup where:
  - Port 5000 (mapped to external port 80) serves the public website
  - Port 5001 (mapped to external port 443) serves the admin portal
- **Domain-Based Routing**: Added server-side middleware to detect admin domains and route requests accordingly.
- **Environment Configuration**: Added ADMIN_DOMAINS environment variable to control which domains are treated as admin domains.
- **Timeout Handling**: Added request timeouts to prevent hanging API requests and improve user experience.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented fallback data structures to ensure components render even when API calls fail.
- **Improved Static File Serving**: Enhanced static file serving with proper caching headers and error handling.
- **Fallback API Routes**: Created dedicated fallback API routes to serve sample data when main API endpoints fail.
- **Multiple Endpoint Retry**: Implemented a system to try multiple endpoints with fallbacks before giving up.
- **Enhanced Client-Side Error Handling**: Updated client components to better handle API errors and display fallback UI.
- **Sample Data Generation**: Added utilities to generate realistic sample data for a better user experience during API outages.

## Next Steps

- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all components load data properly.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Monitor the platform for any additional API issues or error handling improvements.
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing additional caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve performance.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Design Consistency**: Ensuring new features follow the existing theme and practices used in our codebaseâ€”modern, futuristic, and highly micro-interactive.
- **Future Enhancements**: Leaving room for adding additional verification methods (e.g., phone verification) and advanced search filters.
- **User Experience Focus**: Prioritizing seamless navigation and ease of use across all functionalities.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintaining accurate and consistent stats throughout the platform, especially with automated updates upon verification.
