# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Initializing the Memory Bank**: Creating core documentation files to maintain project knowledge across sessions.
- **Enhancing Documentation**: Ensuring all Memory Bank files are comprehensive and up-to-date.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` with detailed project overviews.
- Added `productContext.md` outlining the purpose and goals of the platform.

## Next Steps
- Create and populate the remaining Memory Bank files:
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `progress.md`
- Review and update `.clinerules` with any new patterns or insights.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Consistency**: Maintaining a clear structure across all Memory Bank files.
- **Accuracy**: Ensuring all documented information reflects the current state of the project.
- **Future Updates**: Planning regular reviews of the Memory Bank to keep documentation aligned with project developments.
