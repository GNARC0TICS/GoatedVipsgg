# Progress

## What Works

- **Admin Dashboard**: The admin interface is developed and fully functional, allowing management of users, verification requests, and content.
- **User Profiles**: Every player in the database has an associated user profile that is accessible and visually appealing.
- **Search Functionality**: A search icon has been added to the front-end header, allowing users to search for others by username.
- **QuickProfile Enhancements**: The `QuickProfile` component now includes a button linking to the user's full profile page, ensuring seamless navigation.
- **User Registration & Verification**: Email verification is implemented during registration to confirm user accounts.
- **Linking Profiles to Goated Usernames**: Users can link their profiles to their Goated.com accounts by submitting their UID. Upon verification, their stats are instantly updated and consolidated into their personal profiles.
- **Frontend Components**: Core UI components are developed and functional, including:
  - Enhanced navigation system with dropdown menus
  - Mobile-responsive design with improved menu
  - Rank progress display for mobile users
  - Floating support component
  - Scroll-to-top navigation
  - Improved header with dynamic styling
  - Footer with newsletter subscription
- **Backend API**: Essential API endpoints are implemented and operational, including:
  - User profile management
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Admin operations
  - Search functionality
- **Database Schema**: The database schema is defined and integrated with Drizzle ORM, including:
  - User profiles
  - Admin roles
  - Verification status
  - Search functionality support
- **Telegram Bot**: Basic bot commands are implemented and integrated with the platform.
- **Memory Bank**: Core Memory Bank files are created and maintained to preserve project knowledge.
- **Error Handling & Fallbacks**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms are now implemented for:
  - Leaderboard data loading
  - Wager race position display
  - Static file serving
  - API request timeouts
  - Multiple endpoint retry logic

## What's Left to Build

- **Wager Race Features**: Further enhance wager race functionality, including real-time updates and prize distribution.
- **Notification System**: Implement a robust notification system for push notifications and future email enhancements.
- **Security Enhancements**: Perform security audits and implement best practices.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and API interactions for better performance.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Write unit tests and conduct thorough quality assurance testing.

## Current Status

- The project is in active development with core functionalities implemented and stable.
- Recent focus has been on:
  - Fixing 404 errors in wager race and leaderboard components
  - Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Creating fallback API routes for reliable data display
  - Enhancing static file serving with proper caching headers
  - Implementing multiple endpoint retry logic
  - Generating realistic sample data for API outages
  - Fixing React hooks errors in LeaderboardTable and WagerRacePosition components
- Documentation is up-to-date, with the Memory Bank reflecting recent changes.
- The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.

## Known Issues

- **API Rate Limits**: Need to implement better handling of Goated.com API rate limits.
- **Database Performance**: Optimize queries that are causing slowdowns.
- **Search Optimization**: Further improve search functionality performance and accuracy.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fine-tune mobile navigation and dropdown interactions.
- **API Token Management**: Implement a more sustainable solution for API token management to prevent future expirations.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Consider implementing a more robust solution for managing environment variables across different deployment environments.
