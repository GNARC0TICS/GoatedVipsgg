## What Works

- **Admin Dashboard**: The admin interface is developed and fully functional, allowing management of users, verification requests, and content.
- **User Profiles**: Every player in the database has an associated user profile that is accessible and visually appealing.
- **Search Functionality**: A search icon has been added to the front-end header, allowing users to search for others by username.
- **QuickProfile Enhancements**: The `QuickProfile` component now includes a button linking to the user's full profile page, ensuring seamless navigation.
- **User Registration & Verification**: Email verification is implemented during registration to confirm user accounts.
- **Linking Profiles to Goated Usernames**: Users can link their profiles to their Goated.com accounts by submitting their UID. Upon verification, their stats are instantly updated and consolidated into their personal profiles.
- **Frontend Components**: Core UI components are developed and functional, including:
  - Enhanced navigation system with dropdown menus
  - Mobile-responsive design with improved menu
  - Rank progress display for mobile users
  - Floating support component
  - Scroll-to-top navigation
  - Improved header with dynamic styling
  - Footer with newsletter subscription
- **Backend API**: Essential API endpoints are implemented and operational, including:
  - User profile management
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Admin operations
  - Search functionality
- **Database Schema**: The database schema is defined and integrated with Drizzle ORM, including:
  - User profiles
  - Admin roles
  - Verification status
  - Search functionality support
- **Telegram Bot**: Basic bot commands are implemented and integrated with the platform.
- **Memory Bank**: Core Memory Bank files are created and maintained to preserve project knowledge.

## What's Left to Build

- **Wager Race Features**: Further enhance wager race functionality, including real-time updates and prize distribution.
- **Notification System**: Implement a robust notification system for push notifications and future email enhancements.
- **Security Enhancements**: Continue security audits and implement additional best practices.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Write unit tests and conduct thorough quality assurance testing.

## Current Status

- The project is in active development with core functionalities implemented and stable.
- Recent focus has been on:
  - Implementing a robust API token management system to handle Goated.com API integration
  - Creating an admin interface for API token monitoring and management
  - Developing a TokenService class to handle token storage, validation, and expiration notifications
  - Building an ApiService class that provides centralized API access with retry logic and error handling
  - Optimizing database performance with strategic indexes and connection pooling
  - Enhancing error handling and fallback mechanisms for API interactions
  - Improving leaderboard and wager race components with better resilience
  - Implementing graceful shutdown procedures for database connections
  - Adding detailed health check endpoints for better monitoring
  - Creating fallback data mechanisms for when external APIs are unavailable
- Documentation is up-to-date, with the Memory Bank reflecting recent changes.
- The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.

## Known Issues
