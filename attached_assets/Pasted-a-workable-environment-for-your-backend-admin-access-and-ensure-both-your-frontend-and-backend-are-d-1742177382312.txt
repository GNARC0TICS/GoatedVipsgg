a workable environment for your backend admin access and ensure both your frontend and backend are deployed on the same server, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Your Authentication System
User Model: Ensure you have a user model with fields like username, password, isAdmin, etc. This should be created in your database schema.

Password Hashing: Use the existing hash and compare functions from your server/auth.ts file for user authentication.

Session Management: Use express-session and passport to handle sessions. Verify that you have the setupAuth() function called in your main server file (e.g., server/index.ts).

Step 2: Implement Login Functionality
Add a new route for login in your server (e.g., in server/routes.ts):

import { Router } from "express";
import passport from "passport";
import { checkAuthenticated } from "./middleware/auth"; // Middleware to check if user is authenticated
const router = Router();
// Auth Login Route
router.post('/api/login', passport.authenticate('local'), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ user: req.user, message: "Logged in successfully!" });
});
// Protect Admin Routes
router.use('/admin', checkAuthenticated);
// Admin Dashboard Route
router.get('/admin', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Welcome to the Admin Dashboard");
});
export default router;
Step 3: Create the Admin Dashboard
In your frontend, for your admin dashboard, ensure you navigate to the admin routes as per your condition in client/src/App.tsx. This is already implemented, but ensure the paths are correct.

Step 4: Implement "Remember Me" Functionality
For iOS compatibility, you can implement a "Remember Me" functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) which will allow the user to stay logged in:

Generate a JWT token on successful login and send it as a cookie (set with HttpOnly and secure flags when deployed with HTTPS).

Modify the login route to include token generation:

import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
// Replace your login success callback with this
router.post('/api/login', passport.authenticate('local'), (req, res) => {
    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: req.user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true }); // Set secure to true in production
    res.json({ message: "Logged in successfully!" });
});
Step 5: Fetch User Info and Wager Races
Create endpoints in your server that your frontend can call to get user information and wager races. For example:

// Middleware: Check Admin
export const checkAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user && req.user.isAdmin) {
        return next();
    }
    return res.status(403).send("Not authorized");
};
// Example route to get user data
router.get('/admin/users', checkAdmin, async (req, res) => {
    const users = await getUsersFromDatabase(); // Implement this function to retrieve users
    res.json(users);
});
Step 6: Frontend Integration
Ensure your frontend is making API calls to fetch the data:

Use fetch or your preferred HTTP client to call these endpoints from your admin components (e.g., UserManagement, NotificationManagement).
Step 7: Deploy Both Frontend and Backend
Since you already have the port configurations set up, make sure when deploying:

Your backend is available at 0.0.0.0:5000 for API requests.
Your frontend serves normally on port 80.
Step 8: Test
Once everything is set up, ensure to test:

Admin access point: Only let admins get to the /admin routes.
Functionality: Ensure you can log in, view user info, and manage wager races.
