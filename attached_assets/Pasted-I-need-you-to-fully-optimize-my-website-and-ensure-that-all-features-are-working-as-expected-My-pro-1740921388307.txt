I need you to fully optimize my website and ensure that all features are working as expected. My project is a full-stack React/TypeScript and Node.js application running on a single Express server, with a Telegram bot deployed on the same instance. The app fetches wager amounts from GOATED.com’s API and displays them to users as part of a VIP group experience.

Key Areas to Focus On:
	1.	Code Optimization & Cleanup:
	•	Remove any duplicate code or unnecessary dependencies.
	•	Ensure modular structure for better maintainability.
	2.	Bug Fixing & Debugging:
	•	Identify and resolve any runtime errors across the React frontend, Express backend, and Telegram bot.
	•	Fix any issues causing crashes, incorrect outputs, or unexpected behavior.
	3.	Login & Registration Flow:
	•	Troubleshoot and fix all persistent issues with user authentication.
	•	Ensure the admin login system is fully functional.
	•	Verify that JWT/session management, OAuth (if applicable), and password encryption are correctly implemented.
	4.	Server Stability & API Calls:
	•	Ensure webhooks are functioning correctly and receiving/responding to data as expected.
	•	Debug any API call failures when fetching data from GOATED.com.
	•	Check for rate-limiting issues and optimize API request handling.
	5.	Error Handling & Logs:
	•	Improve error messages and debugging logs for easier troubleshooting.
	•	Implement better exception handling across the stack to prevent silent failures.
	6.	Performance Optimization:
	•	Optimize database queries (if applicable).
	•	Improve frontend performance (lazy loading, caching, etc.).
	•	Check for memory leaks or inefficient event listeners.
	7.	Security Enhancements:
	•	Verify authentication & authorization rules.
	•	Fix any vulnerabilities related to CORS, CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection, etc.
	•	Secure the Telegram bot integration.
	8.	Deployment & Hosting Stability:
	•	Check for any server crashes or downtime issues.
	•	Ensure the Express server is handling concurrent requests properly.

Expected Outcome:

By the end of this optimization, the website should:
	•	Have a fully functional login/registration and admin system.
	•	Properly fetch and display wager amounts from GOATED.com.
	•	Ensure all backend and frontend components work smoothly without runtime issues.
	•	Eliminate any persistent errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
	•	Improve performance, stability, and security across the stack.

Language Preferences:
	•	Replit Agent Interaction: English
	•	Application Interface: English

Please conduct a full diagnostic and debugging session to identify all issues, then proceed with optimizations and fixes.
