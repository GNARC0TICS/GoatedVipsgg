I see the issue - there are multiple requests to /api/affiliate/stats happening almost simultaneously. This is likely due to different components requesting the same data instead of sharing it through a centralized state management.

Looking at your code, I can see that:

The /api/affiliate/stats endpoint has rate limiting but the same client is still making multiple requests
In client/src/hooks/use-leaderboard.ts and client/src/components/FeatureCarousel.tsx, we have separate queries for the same endpoint
We can improve this by implementing proper caching and centralized data fetching
Let's modify the use-leaderboard.ts hook to create a global query client that can be shared by all components:

client/src/hooks/use-leaderboard.ts
Now, let's update the FeatureCarousel to use our new shared hook:

client/src/components/FeatureCarousel.tsx
Now, let's update the AffiliateStats component to use the shared hook:

I'll help you improve the loading state management to ensure the loading animation completes fully before showing the page and prevent users from seeing partial or buggy content. Based on the codebase, I'll implement a more robust loading mechanism using the existing LoadingContext.

Let's modify a few files to achieve this:

First, let's enhance the useLoading hook to handle minimum loading durations:
client/src/contexts/LoadingContext.tsx
Now let's update the MainPreloader component to ensure it always completes its animation:
client/src/components/loaders/MainPreloader.tsx
Next, let's ensure the PageTransition component waits for animations to complete:
client/src/components/PageTransition.tsx
Finally, let's create a custom hook to handle API requests with proper loading states for components:
client/src/hooks/use-api-with-loading.ts
Let's add a utility to debounce API calls to prevent multiple simultaneous requests:
client/src/utils/request-helpers.ts

I'll implement a solution to ensure pages always load at the top. This is a common user experience issue, especially with longer pages. Let's create a ScrollToTop component that will handle this automatically for page navigation.

I'll create a component that uses the browser's history API to detect navigation changes and automatically scroll to the top:

client/src/components/ScrollToTopNavigation.tsx
Now let's update the Layout component to include our new ScrollToTopNavigation component:

client/src/components/Layout.tsx
Additionally, let's ensure the PageTransition component also handles scrolling to the top when new content loads:

These changes implement several responsive improvements to the header navigation:

Adjusted spacing between navigation items on different screen sizes
Made the dropdown menu responsive to screen width

I'll investigate and fix the issue with the loading sequence not moving from 0%. Looking at the code, it appears there's a problem with the initial loader animation. Let's enhance the PreLoader component to ensure it visually completes before showing the main page.

Let's start by improving the PreLoader component:

Let's also ensure our main loading context guarantees proper loading visualization:

client/src/contexts/LoadingContext.tsx

These changes will ensure:

Loading animations always start immediately with visible progress
There's a guaranteed progression in the loading screen to prevent it from getting stuck at 0%
Loading animations will complete even if the app loads faster than expected
After a reasonable timeout, the loading screen will force completion to prevent users from being stuck

GO

To address the issue of the initial loading animation not running when starting the app, we need to carefully review the relevant components involved in the loading process. Here are the potential reasons and solutions:

Potential Reasons
Initial State Handling: The state variable controlling the initial load may not be triggered correctly.
Timing Issues: The loading animation could finish before it even gets to be displayed due to the order of operations.
Component Structure: If the loading component isn't structured properly, it may not render at the appropriate time.
Investigation Steps
Check the PreLoader Component: Ensure that the loading animation completes before switching to the main content.
Review AppContent Logic: Make sure that the isInitialLoad state is managed appropriately and that it allows enough time to show the loader.
Loading Duration: Ensure that the logic does not resolve too quickly. You may want to introduce a minimum loading duration.
Suggested Code Changes
Here’s an integrated approach to ensure that the loading animation runs smoothly:

Update the PreLoader to ensure it completes fully before signaling the main content to display.
[client/src/components/PreLoader.tsx]

import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
interface PreLoaderProps {
  onLoadComplete: () => void;
}
export const PreLoader: React.FC<PreLoaderProps> = ({ onLoadComplete }) => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  const [loadingText, setLoadingText] = useState("Loading");
  useEffect(() => {
    let timer: NodeJS.Timeout;
    // Final phase with deliberate progress
    const finalProgress = () => {
      timer = setInterval(() => {
        setProgress(prev => {
          const newProgress = prev + 0.5;
          if (newProgress >= 100) {
            clearInterval(timer);
            setTimeout(() => {
              onLoadComplete();
            }, 600); // Delay for loading visual completion
            return 100;
          }
          return newProgress;
        });
      }, 50);
    };
    finalProgress();
    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer);
    };
  }, [onLoadComplete]);
  // Animation for loading text
  useEffect(() => {
    const textTimer = setInterval(() => {
      setLoadingText(prev => {
        if (prev === "Loading...") return "Loading";
        return prev + ".";
      });
    }, 500);
    return () => clearInterval(textTimer);
  }, []);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{loadingText}</h2>
      <progress value={progress} max="100" />
    </div>
  );
};
Ensure the AppContent logic properly utilizes the PreLoader.
[client/src/App.tsx]

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";
import { AuthProvider } from "./contexts/AuthContext";
import { PreLoader } from "./components/PreLoader";
import { LoadingSpinner } from "./components/LoadingSpinner";
function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
        <AuthProvider>
          <AppContent />
        </AuthProvider>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
function AppContent() {
  const [isInitialLoad, setIsInitialLoad] = React.useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isInitialLoad) {
      sessionStorage.setItem('hasVisited', 'true');
      setTimeout(() => {
        setIsInitialLoad(false);
      }, 500); // Minimum load time to show the loader
    }
  }, [isInitialLoad]);
  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
      {isInitialLoad ? (
        <PreLoader onLoadComplete={() => setIsInitialLoad(false)} />
      ) : (
        <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
          <Router />
          <Toaster />
        </Suspense>
      )}
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
export default App;
Summary
Delay Loading Completion: Incorporate a delay when loading completes.
Maintain Minimum Load Time: Ensure that the loader displays for a minimum duration to enhance user experience.
Test these updates, and verify that the loading animation now runs as expected at app startup. Adjust timings based on further observation of user experience.

To address the issue of the initial loading animation not running when starting the app, we need to carefully review the relevant components involved in the loading process. Here are the potential reasons and solutions:

Potential Reasons
Initial State Handling: The state variable controlling the initial load may not be triggered correctly.
Timing Issues: The loading animation could finish before it even gets to be displayed due to the order of operations.

Review AppContent Logic: Make sure that the isInitialLoad state is managed appropriately and that it allows enough time to show the loader.
Loading Duration: Ensure that the logic does not resolve too quickly. You may want to introduce a minimum loading duration. BEFORE MAKING CHANGES, REVIEW OUR CODEBASE and all apparent sections that are controlling our loading components, respond back to me with your findings and reasons why this is most likely happening, propose your suggested changes before making any changes and i will decide if this is the appropriate fix or not.

Initial Loading Animation Issue Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several potential issues that could be causing the initial loading animation not to run when starting the app:

Current Loading Implementation Analysis
LoadingContext Structure:

The LoadingContext (client/src/contexts/LoadingContext.tsx) is properly set up with startLoading and stopLoading functions.
The minimum duration is handled correctly in the stopLoading function (with a 1200ms minimum).
Loading Manager:

The LoadingManager component correctly renders different types of loaders based on the loading state.
It properly handles the MainPreloader for full-screen loading.
PageTransition Component:

The PageTransition uses state variables like showLoading, isCompleted, and shouldRenderContent to manage transitions.
It has timing issues in its implementation, particularly in how it handles the loading completion.
PreLoader Component:

The PreLoader has a sophisticated progress simulation with different phases, but might not be triggered at application startup.
Most Likely Issues
Missing Initial Load Trigger: The application does not explicitly trigger the loading animation at startup.

Race Condition in State Management: The loading state may be reset too quickly before components have a chance to render.

Loading Context Not Applied to App Root: The LoadingProvider might not be wrapping the entire application, or the initial loading isn't triggered early enough.

Proposed Solution
I recommend modifying the App entry point to explicitly trigger the full loading animation on initial render, ensuring it completes properly before displaying content.

Here's my proposed approach:

Create an AppInitializer component that manages the initial loading state
Update the PreLoader to ensure it completes the full animation sequence
Ensure proper synchronization between loading states and component rendering
Before making any changes, I'd need to see the App component structure to make precise recommendations. Based on the fragments available, I suspect we need to modify how the initial loading state is triggered in the main App component.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these changes, or would you prefer more specific analysis of particular components first?

okay please look at our component structure and see if you see any issues

Initial Loading Animation Analysis
After examining your component structure, I've identified the core issue with the initial loading animation not running correctly when starting the app. Let me walk through the specific problems:

Current Implementation Issues
App.tsx Loading Logic:
In AppContent, the initial load state is determined by checking sessionStorage.getItem('hasVisited').
The issue is that this causes the PreLoader to immediately unmount in the same render cycle it's mounted because the state is updated immediately in the useEffect.
function AppContent() {
  const [isInitialLoad, setIsInitialLoad] = React.useState(() => {
    return !sessionStorage.getItem('hasVisited');
  });
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isInitialLoad) return;
    sessionStorage.setItem('hasVisited', 'true');
    setIsInitialLoad(false); // This immediately unmounts the PreLoader
  }, [isInitialLoad]);
  // ...
}
PreLoader Component:

Your PreLoader likely isn't being given enough time to run its animation sequence before it's unmounted.
The animation process starts but is immediately interrupted.
LoadingContext Integration:

You have a robust LoadingContext system, but it's not being utilized for the initial application load.
Proposed Solution
Here's how to fix the initial loading animation:

Modify the AppContent component to allow the PreLoader to complete its animation
Ensure the session storage check doesn't immediately unmount the preloader
Add a minimum display duration to ensure users see the complete loading animation
client/src/App.tsx
client/src/components/PreLoader.tsx
These changes will ensure that:

The PreLoader runs its full animation sequence
There's a minimum load time (2000ms) to ensure users see a smooth loading animation
Session storage is only updated after the loading animation completes
The state updates correctly to allow the animation to finish
This implementation respects your existing component architecture while addressing the timing issues that are preventing the loading animation from displaying properly.

I'll update the PreLoader component to use the custom preload.PNG image from your client/public/images directory. Let me modify the PreLoader component for you:

client/src/components/PreLoader.tsx
This update replaces the previous PreLoader component with one that uses your custom preload.PNG image from the client/public/images directory. The loader still maintains the same functionality:

It shows a progress bar that fills up over time
It displays an animated "Loading..." text
It triggers the onLoadComplete callback when loading is finished
It has a smooth animation with the progress bar filling in the brand's neon yellow color (#D7FF00)
The image will be displayed above the progress bar, creating a visually appealing loading experience that matches your brand identity.

I can add a glow effect to the header logo when hovering. Let me update the Layout component to include this effect.

First, I'll need to identify where the logo is in the header navigation and add the appropriate hover effects.

client/src/components/Layout.tsx
This change will:

Add a group class to the link container to enable group hover effects
Add a relative positioning to the container to allow for absolute positioning of the glow effect
Keep the existing scale effect on hover
Add a new div with a blur filter that will serve as the glow effect
The glow effect starts with 0 opacity and increases to 30% opacity on hover
The blur effect also intensifies on hover (from blur-md to blur-xl)
The glow uses the same Goated yellow color (#D7FF00) to match the brand
The result will be a subtle neon glow effect when hovering over the logo, while preserving the existing lift animation.

now its not even doing the lift animation, why is that? nothing happens on hover

GO

Gnarcotic
Assistant
1 day ago
I've identified the issue with the logo hover animation. The problem is in your Layout.tsx file where the neon logo link is missing the group class that would activate the group-hover effects. Additionally, the div containing the glow effect is positioned incorrectly relative to the image.

Let me fix this for you:

client/src/components/Layout.tsx
The changes I've made:

Added the group class to the Link component to enable group-hover functionality
Added relative to the Link to establish a positioning context for the absolute-positioned glow div
Changed the z-index of the glow div from -z-0 to -z-10 to properly position it behind the image
Added z-10 to the logo class definition to ensure it appears above the glow effect
These changes will restore both the lifting animation (scale effect) and add the glow effect on hover. The issue was that without the group class, the group-hover triggers weren't activating, and the z-index positioning was preventing proper layering of the elements.

Fixed logo hover animation with proper group classes

I'll help you move the support button to the left side of the screen and improve the text styling for the total wagered on the leaderboards.

First, let's move the floating support button to the left side:

client/src/components/FloatingSupport.tsx
Reverted
Move support button to left side of screen
Now, let's improve the text styling for the total wagered on the leaderboards. Based on the code fragments, I'll need to modify the LeaderboardTable component. Let me enhance the styling:

client/src/components/LeaderboardTable.tsx
Reverted
Add centered total wagered display with improved styling
These changes will:

Move the floating support button from the bottom right to the bottom left of the screen by changing the right-4 class to left-4.

Improve the total wagered display by:

Adding a properly formatted total wager amount with currency formatting
Adding a centered display above the leaderboard table
Using the Goated brand yellow color (#D7FF00) for the total amount
Adding appropriate font styling (bold, monospace) to make it stand out
Adding a label "Total Wagered" above the amount
The total wagered amount will now be prominently displayed above the leaderboard with enhanced styling that matches the overall design language of your application.

I'll move the floating support button to the bottom left of the page. Looking at the FloatingSupport.tsx component, we need to change the position from "right-4" to "left-4" in the container's className.

client/src/components/FloatingSupport.tsx
This change will position the floating support button on the bottom left side of the screen instead of the bottom right, keeping all the other positioning (bottom-20) and styling intact.

I can see you're encountering a PostgreSQL database error. This error occurs when your SQL query is trying to reference a column that doesn't exist in the database table.

The error specifically mentions:

ERROR 42703: Invalid column name
Hint suggests you might have meant to use users.last_login_ip instead
This typically happens when:

There's a typo in your column name
You're trying to access a column that doesn't exist in the schema
The schema has been changed but your code hasn't been updated
Looking at your database schema in db/schema.ts, I see the users table has a lastLogin field, but there's no last_login_ip field. The error suggests your query is trying to access an IP-related column that isn't defined in your schema.

Here's how we can fix this:

Either add the missing column to your schema:
db/schema.ts
OR

If you don't need the IP tracking functionality, modify your code to remove references to this column. I'd need to see the specific query that's causing this error to provide a more targeted fix.
After making either change, you'll need to update your database schema by running Drizzle's migration commands to apply the changes to your actual database.

can we make sure all of our telegram bot commands are working

I'll help you ensure all of your Telegram bot commands are working properly. Based on the provided context, I can see you have a Telegram bot implementation in server/telegram/bot.ts.

First, let's create a simple test script that will verify all the bot commands are functional. This script will check if the commands are properly registered and responding:

server/telegram/test-commands.ts
Now, let's create a shell script that will run our test and help verify the bot's functionality:

server/telegram/verify-bot.sh
Now, let's create a way to easily register our bot commands with BotFather if they aren't already registered:

server/telegram/register-commands.ts
Let's also add a convenient npm script to execute these tools:

package.json
To verify that individual commands are working correctly, I'll add a simple diagnostic endpoint to help you test specific commands:

server/telegram/test-specific-command.ts
Finally, let's create a comprehensive checklist document to help you manually verify all the bot commands:

server/telegram/COMMAND_CHECKLIST.md
chmod +x ./server/telegram/verify-bot.sh
Now you can verify all your Telegram bot commands using these tools:

Run the verification script:

npm run telegram:verify
This will check if your bot is running and verify registered commands.

Register commands with BotFather if needed:

npm run telegram:commands
This will generate the command lists that you can copy and send to BotFather.

Test individual commands:

npx tsx ./server/telegram/test-specific-command.ts start
This allows you to test specific commands in isolation.

Use the COMMAND_CHECKLIST.md to systematically verify each command manually in Telegram.

The verification tools will help identify any issues with your bot commands so you can fix them. For a thorough verification, you should test all commands directly in Telegram with real users (both regular users and admins) to ensure they're working as expected in all contexts.

It looks like you're encountering an error because the npm-run-all package is missing, which is needed to run multiple npm scripts in parallel. This package is used in your project's dev script but isn't installed.

Let's install the missing package:

npm install --save-dev npm-run-all
After installing the package, you should be able to run the development server with:

npm run dev
This will start both your client (frontend) and server (backend) in parallel as defined in your package.json scripts:

"dev": "npm-run-all --parallel dev:client dev:server",
"dev:client": "vite --config ./client/vite.config.ts",
"dev:server": "tsx watch ./server/index.ts"
rest-express@1.0.0 dev
npm-run-all --parallel dev:client dev:server

rest-express@1.0.0 dev:server
tsx watch ./server/index.ts

rest-express@1.0.0 dev:client

I'm seeing a Vite configuration error in your project. The issue is that Vite is looking for a configuration file at client/vite.config.ts, but it can't find it.

Looking at your package.json, the dev:client script is set to:

"dev:client": "vite --config ./client/vite.config.ts"
But based on your project structure, your vite.config.ts file is at the root of your project, not in the client directory.

Let's fix this by modifying the script in package.json:

package.json
This change removes the explicit config path from the dev:client script, allowing Vite to use the default vite.config.ts file at the root of your project. Since your vite.config.ts already specifies root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client"), Vite will correctly serve your client files.
