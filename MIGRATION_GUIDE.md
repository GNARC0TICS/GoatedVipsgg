# Migration Guide: Simplifying GoatedVIPs Platform

## Overview
This guide outlines the process of simplifying the V2 platform while maintaining its core improvements. The goal is to reduce complexity and error potential while keeping the enhanced features and UI improvements.

## Current Progress (As of February 22, 2025)

### Phase 1: Authentication Simplification âš¡
Status: IN PROGRESS ðŸŸ¡

#### Completed Steps âœ…
1. Backend Changes:
   - Simplified user schema to essential fields
   - Configured PostgreSQL session store
   - Removed JWT complexity in favor of pure session-based auth
   - Added dynamic port selection for development server
   - Implemented server health check endpoint
   - Added server readiness verification
   - Consolidated route handlers in server/routes.ts
   - Implemented proper session store with PostgreSQL

#### Current Step ðŸ”„
Authentication System Testing:
- Setting up session store and testing authentication flow
- Need to resolve server configuration issues preventing API access
- Debugging port configuration and API routing problems

#### Immediate Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Server Configuration Fixes:
   - Resolve port conflicts between Vite and API server
   - Ensure proper proxy setup for API requests
   - Test API endpoints accessibility
   - Verify session store functionality

2. Authentication Testing:
   - Test registration endpoint
   - Verify login functionality
   - Confirm session persistence
   - Implement proper error handling

3. Frontend Integration:
   - Create AuthProvider component
   - Implement protected routes
   - Add authentication hooks
   - Set up proper loading states

### Future Phases

#### Phase 2: Server Architecture Consolidation
1. WebSocket Implementation:
   - Simplify WebSocket server setup
   - Implement reconnection logic
   - Add proper error handling
   - Set up event handling system

2. Route Organization:
   - Clean up route handlers
   - Implement consistent error responses
   - Add request validation
   - Set up proper logging

#### Phase 3: Form Handling Optimization
1. Form Components:
   - Unify form validation logic
   - Implement consistent error handling
   - Add loading states
   - Create reusable form components

2. Data Management:
   - Optimize React Query usage
   - Implement proper cache invalidation
   - Add optimistic updates
   - Set up proper error boundaries

## Next Session Tasks
1. Fix development server configuration to properly handle API requests
2. Test authentication endpoints after server configuration is fixed
3. Complete session store implementation and testing
4. Begin frontend authentication implementation

Would you like to proceed with fixing the server configuration in the next session?
