   - Protected routes for authenticated areas

### Backend Architecture

1. **API Layer**
   - Express.js server with TypeScript
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Authentication middleware
   - Rate limiting for security

2. **Database Layer**

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - User registers via web UI or Telegram
   - Authentication credentials verified
   - User profile created in PostgreSQL database
   - Session token issued

2. **Affiliate Activity**
   - User generates unique affiliate links
   - Links are tracked when used by others
   - Conversions are recorded in database
   - Statistics updated in real-time
   - Rewards calculated and issued

3. **Admin Operations**
   - Admins manage promotions and bonus codes
   - System configurations adjusted
   - User management operations
   - Analytics monitoring and reporting

4. **Telegram Interactions**
   - Users interact with Telegram bot
   - Commands processed by Node.js backend
   - Responses generated (static or AI-assisted)
   - User actions tracked and stored in database

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication Security**
   - JWT-based token system
   - Firebase secure authentication
   - Session management

2. **API Protection**
   - Rate limiting middleware
   - Request validation using Zod
   - Protected routes for sensitive operations

3. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation on both client and server
   - Zod schema validation for data integrity
   - Error handling and sanitization

## Scalability Considerations
