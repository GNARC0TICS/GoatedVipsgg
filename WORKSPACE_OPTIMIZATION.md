## 1. Code Optimization Opportunities

### Backend Optimizations

#### 1.1 API Caching Issues ✅

**Current Issues:**
- The leaderboard data caching in `server/routes.ts` has a hardcoded 60-second cache duration but lacks proper cache invalidation strategies
- The `getLeaderboardData()` function doesn't handle race conditions when multiple requests come in simultaneously during cache expiration

**Implemented Solutions:**
- Created a generic `CacheManager` class in `server/utils/cache.ts` that provides:
  - Mutex lock to prevent race conditions during cache refresh
  - Cache versioning for controlled invalidation
  - Proper error handling with stale cache fallback
  - Configurable cache duration
- Implemented a dedicated leaderboard cache in `server/utils/leaderboard-cache.ts` that:
  - Uses the generic cache manager for leaderboard data
  - Provides a clean API for getting and invalidating cached data
  - Handles API errors gracefully
  - Includes proper TypeScript typing
- Updated all routes in `server/routes.ts` to use the new caching mechanism

#### 1.2 Database Connection Management

**Current Issues:**
- The database connection in `db/connection.ts` lacks proper connection pooling configuration
- Missing connection retry logic for transient database failures
- No health check mechanism for database connections

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Implement connection pooling with appropriate min/max connections
- Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create a health check endpoint for database connectivity
- Implement proper connection cleanup on application shutdown

#### 1.3 Error Handling Inconsistencies

**Current Issues:**
- Error handling in `server/middleware/error-handler.ts` is not consistently used across all routes
- Many routes have inline error handling with different response formats
- Missing request IDs for error tracking

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Standardize error handling across all routes using the central error handler
- Create custom error classes for different types of errors
- Add request IDs to track errors across the system
- Implement consistent error logging

#### 1.4 WebSocket Implementation

**Current Issues:**
- WebSocket connections in `server/routes.ts` lack proper authentication
- Missing heartbeat mechanism to detect stale connections
- No connection tracking or management

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Add authentication to WebSocket connections
- Implement proper heartbeat mechanism
- Create a WebSocket manager for connection tracking
- Add error handling for WebSocket connections

### Frontend Optimizations

#### 1.5 React Query Usage

**Current Issues:**
- Inconsistent usage of React Query across components
- Missing proper query invalidation strategies
- No query prefetching for common data

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Standardize React Query usage with a centralized query client
- Implement proper query invalidation strategies
- Add query prefetching for common data
- Optimize query caching and stale time settings

#### 1.6 Component Rendering Efficiency

**Current Issues:**
- `LeaderboardTable.tsx` re-renders unnecessarily due to missing memoization
- Heavy animations in components may cause performance issues on mobile devices
- No virtualization for large data sets

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Add proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize animations for performance
- Implement virtualized lists for large data sets
- Add conditional rendering for heavy components on mobile

#### 1.7 Authentication State Management

**Current Issues:**
- The auth context in `client/src/lib/auth.tsx` fetches user data on every page load
- Token refresh mechanism is missing
- No persistent authentication state

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Add persistent authentication state
- Optimize authentication state management
- Implement proper loading states for authentication

#### 1.8 Loading State Management

**Current Issues:**
- The `LoadingContext.tsx` has inconsistent usage across components
- Missing granular loading states for different operations
- No skeleton loaders for better UX

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Standardize loading state handling
- Add more granular loading states
- Implement skeleton loaders for better UX
- Add timeout handling for long-running operations

## 2. Inconsistencies & Unclear Code

#### 2.1 Naming Conventions

**Current Issues:**
- Inconsistent file naming: some files use kebab-case (`use-leaderboard.ts`) while others use PascalCase (`LeaderboardTable.tsx`)
- Inconsistent function naming patterns
- No clear style guide for the project

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Standardize file naming conventions
- Standardize function and component naming
- Create a style guide for the project
- Add linting rules to enforce conventions

#### 2.2 API Response Formats

**Current Issues:**
- Different API endpoints return different response structures
- Some endpoints return `{ status, data }` while others return direct data objects
- No consistent error response format

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Standardize API response formats
- Create response wrapper utilities
- Document API response formats
- Add type definitions for API responses

#### 2.3 Type Definitions

**Current Issues:**
- Some components lack proper TypeScript interfaces
- Inconsistent usage of type imports from the database schema
- Missing type definitions for API responses

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Add comprehensive type definitions
- Centralize common types
- Use consistent type imports
- Add proper documentation to types

#### 2.4 Code Duplication

**Current Issues:**
- Multiple implementations of authentication logic
- Repeated data transformation functions across files
- Duplicated utility functions

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Extract duplicated code into reusable utilities
- Create shared service modules
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Document shared utilities

#### 2.5 Configuration Management

**Current Issues:**
- Environment variables are accessed directly in some files and through config objects in others
- Hardcoded values scattered throughout the codebase
- No validation for required configuration

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Centralize configuration management
- Create environment-specific configuration
- Add validation for required configuration
- Document configuration options
